0x01. ES6 Promises
What are Promises?

Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They offer a cleaner and more structured approach compared to traditional callback functions.

Benefits of Promises:

Improved code readability: Promises lead to cleaner and more predictable code flow.
Error handling: Promises allow for better error handling by chaining .catch() methods.
Chaining: You can chain multiple asynchronous operations with ease using .then() methods.
Basic Promise Structure:

JavaScript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Perform asynchronous operation here
  if (operationSuccessful) {
    resolve(result); // Resolve the promise with a result
  } else {
    reject(error); // Reject the promise with an error
  }
});
Use code with caution.

Consuming Promises:

JavaScript
promise.then(
  (result) => {
    // Handle successful outcome with the result
  },
  (error) => {
    // Handle error
  }
);
Use code with caution.

Chaining Promises:

JavaScript
promise1.then(
  (result1) => {
    return promise2(result1);
  }
).then(
  (result2) => {
    // Handle final result
  }
).catch(
  (error) => {
    // Handle any errors in the chain
  }
);
